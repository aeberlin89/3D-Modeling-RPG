# 3D-Modeling-RPG

The main goal of this project is to get comfortable making 3D models in Blender so that they can be used in Unity projects.
Starting with the player model, then moving to armor, weapons, environment, enemies, buildings, etc. 

Initial scene items (environment, trees, campfire, lampposts, etc) are part of the RPG tutorial package from devassets.com by Brackeys and Sebastian Lague
